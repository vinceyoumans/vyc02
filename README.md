VY Challenge

## Getting Started

This is the Challenge for 
Vincent Youmans
using Flutter.

Sorry about the Scheduling issues...
but I am traveling in an area with very poor internet.

This code example demonstrates.

A list view pulling data from a local REST server.
However, I could get data from anywhere with a URL and in JSON format.

onTap I display a Details page.


The details page also gives a simple example of a Custom Widget, which 
I believe was discussed during phone interview.

I kept the example as simple as possible.
I used Card widget instead of a ListTile... because I like Cards better than tiles...
but I can do a List Tile example as well.

TODO...
Color...   I should add a bolor box with value of color string.




NOTICE...
This code example should work for iOS..
but it's probably not going to work for android.
REASON.  The test REST server is using localhost.  The Android device also has a local host 
and will probably get a connection refused.

Solution would be to host the REST server on a public IP.
but I am a little short on time...   I may do something similar to this
latter today.
